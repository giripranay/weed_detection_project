# Farm Robot Project

This project simulates a farm robot operating within a ROS (Robot Operating System) environment.  The robot is designed to navigate the farm world, perform weed detection, and potentially other tasks (like motion).

## Setup and Running

These instructions assume you have ROS Noetic installed. If you don't, please refer to the official ROS installation guide for Noetic.

1.  **Unzip the Project Folder:**

    Unzip the project archive to your desired location.

2.  **Navigate to the Workspace:**

    ```bash
    cd project_ws/
    ```

3.  **Source ROS Noetic:**

    ```bash
    source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
    ```

4.  **Configure Display (If Needed):**

    If you are running this project within a Docker container or a remote environment, you may need to set the `DISPLAY` environment variable. Replace `172.23.192.1` with your system's IP address. This is *only* necessary if you are having issues with visualizing the simulation.

    ```bash
    export DISPLAY=172.23.192.1:0.0  # Replace with your IP
    ```

5.  **Build the Workspace:**

    ```bash
    catkin_make
    ```

6.  **Source the Workspace Setup:**

    ```bash
    source devel/setup.bash
    ```

## Running the Simulation (Open multiple terminals)

Open four separate terminals and follow the instructions below in each terminal.  Remember to source the `devel/setup.bash` file in *each* new terminal you open.

**Terminal 1: Launch Farm World and Robot**

```bash
roslaunch farm farm_world.launch
```

**Terminal 2: Robot Motion**

```Bash

cd project_ws/src/farm/scripts

python move.py

```


**Terminal 3: Camera Views**

```Bash

cd project_ws/src/farm/scripts
python on_frontcam.py
```

**Terminal 4: Weed Detection**

```Bash

cd project_ws/src/farm/scripts
python weed_detection.py  # Corrected filename to weed_detection.py (assuming this is the cor
```
